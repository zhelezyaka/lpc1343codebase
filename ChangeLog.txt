v0.80 - 27 Jan 2011
===================

- Added optimised lcdDrawVLine using orientation
  though this should only be used on lines
  greate than 20 pixels or so to see any real
  advantage
- Added cmd_uart to allow the HW UART speed
  to be set in EEPROM (between 9600 and
  115200).  Use the 'U' command.
- Updated Crossworks projects files to use
  custom printf in 'core/libc' (gains about
  1.3KB in release mode)
- Added driver for SSD1306 OLED displays
  to '/drivers/bitmap/ssd1306'
- Changed commands in the CLI to single
  characters and shortened descriptions
  to save flash space (~0.7KB)
- Updated ILI9325 to allow the screen
  orientation to be changed to portrait
  of landscape mode.
- Added cmd_orientation to change the LCD
  orientation from the CLI
- Fixed a bug in the PMU Wakeup interrupt
  handler
- Added a circular buffer for outgoing CDC
  data (cdc_buf.c) since you can only feed one
  frame per ms (max 64 bytes).  The speed needs
  to be improved finding the right balance
  between caching data and sending it to the EP,
  but this should avoid any dropped characters.
  More testing will be needed to improve this.
- Fixed a bug with the USB CDC buffer
- Added SILENTMODE to the CLI to disable the
  command prompt and echo of input characters
  (see CFG_INTERFACE_SILENTMODE).  Useful
  when another MCU is use the CLI rather than
  a human.
- Added IRQ pin to the CLI to indicate when a 
  command is being processed (pin = low) and
  when it has completed or a new command can
  be processed (pin = high).
- Added 'cmd_tswait' to wait for a touch event
- Removed 'drivers/nfc/pn532' until proper drivers
  can be written
- Added 'cmd_text' and 'cmd_textw' to the CLI to
  render text on the LCD and get the width in
  pixels of the specified text before rendering.

v0.70 - 18 Dec 2010
===================

- Added 'calibrate' and 'gettext' commands to the CLI
- Added a dialogue box for the TFT LCD/Touchscreen
  to input alpha-numeric data and return the
  results as a string ('drivers/lcd/tft/dialogues/*')
- Added touch screen calibration code and UI
  ('drivers/lcd/tft/touchscreen.c')
- Fixed a bug in ILI9325.c to make sure that the LCD
  is reset during initialisation
- ** IMPORTANT ** Changed 'core/i2c/*' to fix a number
  of bugs (thanks Rob65!) ... though this means all
  i2c peripherals and drivers will need to be tested.
- Added 'colorscheme_t' to drawing.h to try to use a
  standard color palette across GUI controls and make
  it easy to change later.  Currently only the button
  and progress bar make use of this.
- Added 'lcdBacklightOn()' and 'lcdBacklightOff()' to
  lcd.h
- Added 'CFG_TFTLCD_TS_THRESHOLD' to projectconfig.h
  to configure touch-screen sensitivity when waiting
  for a touch event
- Modified 'core/gpio/gpio.c' to reduce the compiled code
  size. Repetitive switches where only the registers
  change were modified to use temporary registers and
  execute the code only once.
- Added the source and binaries for TheDotFactory to
  'tools/dotfactory' for convenience sake. See:
  http://www.pavius.net/downloads/tools/53-the-dot-factory
- Removed 'drivers/lcd/tft/tscalibration.c' and moved
  the relevant code to touchscreen.c
- Removed the imgconv tool from 'tools/imgconv' (see
  point below for more information)
- Removed the previous custom image code and replaced
  it with 24-bit Windows bitmap files.  This is a bit
  slower (since 24-bit data needs to be converted to
  RGB565 for each pixel and rows are rendered bottom
  up making pixel drawing harder to optimise) but
  converting and eventually saving images is easier.
  The current code is functional but needs to be
  heavily optimised.
- Made some minor optimisations to the data and cmd
  functions in the ILI9325 driver.  Other functions
  need to be optimised as well, but these two should
  be close to optimal now.  Currently 25 cycles
  compiled with -Os, 36 cycles with no optimisation.
- Added 'projects/command/drawing/cmd_bmp.c' to load
  24-bit Windows bitmap images from the SD card and
  display them on the TFT LCD.
- Added some schematics to '/tools/schematics' to
  show the assumed pin configurations

v0.60 - 8 December 2010
=======================

- Added a number of CLI commands for the TFT LCD
  (see 'project/commands/drawing')
- Modified FCLK_FAST() in 'drivers/fatfs/mmc.c' to set
  the max speed to 6.0MHz for improved reliability.
  Tested with a 4GB microSD card, 300KB/s can be read
  using a 512 byte read buffer.
- Modified Chibi to use 16-bit timer 0 for us delays
  (more accurate)
- Added a number of commands to
  '/projects/commands/drawing' for basic TFT LCD
  operations.  Removed 'lcd-test.c' and 'lcd-fill.c'.
- Added a flag to projectconfig.h to make FATFS read-only
  (to save a couple KB when space is tight).
- Moved 'project/eeprom.*' to 'drivers/eeprom' to add a
  level of abstraction to eeprom access throughout the code
- Added a table to projectconfig.h to manage eeprom
  addresses. First 256 byte of eeprom should be reserved
  for this.
- Added 'drivers/lcd/tft/colors.h' to keep all common
  16-bit RGB565 color definitions in one location
- Added some sample images to 'tools/imgconv' that can
  be used to render a basic clock on a TFT LCD screen
  (using drawImageFromFile in 'drivers/lcd/tft/drawing.c')
- Modified the makefile to automatically run './lpcrc' 
  post-build
- Added drawButton() to 'drivers/lcd/tft/drawing.c'
- Updated 'drivers/lcd/tft/touchscreen.c' to do basic
  debouncing.  tsReadZ() was added to detect pressure on
  the touch screen, and tsWaitForEvent() will only exit
  when the pressure passes a minimum threshold.  (Thanks
  to Limor for pointing out some code by Rossum for this.)
- Fixed some off-by-one pixel errors in cmd-test and
  elsewhere

v0.51 - 27 November 2010
========================

- Added simple RSA encryption/decryption driver.  Currently limited to
  using 64-bit and 32-bit numbers in key pairs, which isn't terribly secure,
  but allows much smaller code size than if huge number support was included.
- Added a driver for the MCP4725 I2C DAC (see "drivers/dac/mcp4725").
- Moved 'rom_drivers.h' from 'core/usbhid-rom' to 'core' since it can be used
  for usbmsd-rom as well if it is implemented at a later date.
- ili9325ReadData() added to ili9325.c by Adafruit Industries (thanks!)
- Modified FCLK_FAST() in 'drivers/fatfs/mmc.c' to set fast SPI speed
  to 18MHz instead of the previous 4MHz.  This allows for slightly faster
  rendering of bitmap images from SD cards, amongst other things.
- Fixed ILI9325 driver to use 0,0 based pixels and not 1x1, meaning the
  pixel co-ordinates are 0..239 for X and 0..319 for Y.  There may still be
  some off-by-one pixel issues that need to be further tested.

v0.50 - 26 October 2010
=======================

- Moved command.c and cmd_tbl.h to /project to try to keep all 
  project-specific files in one location to improve code-sharing and make
  upgrading easier
- Created seperate .c files for every command for the command-line interface
  to make it easier to maintain and share code between projects.  All commands
  listed in cmd_tbl.h are now stored in their own files in /project/commands 
  (ex.: "/project/commands/cmd_hello.c", etc.)
- Added a CLI command to demonstrate how to draw to the ILI9325 TFT LCD
- Added a CLI command to show the contents of any directory from the SD card 
  (/project/commmands/cmd_sd_dir.c)
- Added a CLI command showing how to enter deep-sleep and exit with a SW
  wakeup (/project/commands/cmd_deepsleep.c).  Please note that the wakeup
  will not work if you are using USB for the CLI.  To see the wakeup message,
  you must use UART for the CLI, which is selected by uncommenting
  CFG_PRINTF_UART in projectconfig.h
- Fixed pmu.c to set the core clock back to an appropriate state after wakeup
- Added simple wrapper for eeprom access (projects/eeprom.c)
- Reorganised drivers/lcd to take into account non TFT LCD displays.
- Added a preliminary (experimental) driver for 128x64 pixel ST7565-based
  bitmap LCDs (ex: Adafruit Industries - http://bit.ly/9xj5vw) ... based on a
  driver from Limor Fried at Adafruit
- Numerous bug fixes added by Roel Verdult (Linux compatibility, GCC warnings, etc.)
- Added stub files for PN532 driver (/drivers/nfc/pn532), and added CFG_PN532 to
  projectconfig.h as an option
- Added a simple pwm example using 16-bit timer 1 and p1.9 (MAT0) for the output.  PWM can be used
  to drive stepper motors, or to dim LEDs by adjusting the duty-cycle, etc.  The example can be
  found in "/core/pwm"
- Added a bi-polar stepper motor driver based on the Arduino library.  Basic position data was added
  to detece deviation from the 'Home' position and to retrieve the spindle's current angle.  See
  "drivers/motor/stepper" for more information.
- Added test firmware for the UART and USBCDC CLI (tools/testfirmware)
- Added a table to projectconfig.h to try to keep track of pin and peripherals
  usage by drivers and the included SW examples.
- Reorganised some pins used by drivers to avoid pin conflicts.
- Modified core/timer16/timer16.c to allow PWM output to be stopped after a
  certain number of pulses have been sent out.

  KNOWN ISSUES
  
- USB CDC Output is brutally slow because of an endpoint issue with BULKIN/BULKOUT.
  This is a known issue, but we haven't had the time to find a solution.  This will be
  a high-priority update in the next revision.
- The SPI code needs to be modified to allow several SPI devices to be safely
  connected on the same bus.  At present, this has not been tested since the
  SSP/SPI blocks are used exclusively in the current drivers.
